# Data-Cleaning-Create-an-Analytical-Dataset
This project was copleted to practice data preprocessing and data cleaning skills. The original data and project was created by Udacity, from the Nanodegree 'Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree'. The original project used Alteryx to clean the data, which is way easier than using Python. For practice purposes, I used Python to clean the data and extracted the same result as shown in the right answer.

## Project Overview (Provided by Udacity)
### Scenario
Pawdacity is a leading pet store chain in Wyoming with 13 stores throughout the state. This year, Pawdacity would like to expand and open a 14th store. Your manager has asked you to perform an analysis to recommend the city for Pawdacityâ€™s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.

Your manager has given you the following information to work with:

The monthly sales data for all of the Pawdacity stores for the year 2010.
NAICS data on the most current sales of all competitor stores where total sales is equal to 12 months of sales.
A partially parsed data file that can be used for population numbers.
Demographic data (Households with individuals under 18, Land Area, Population Density, and Total Families) for each city and county in the state of Wyoming. For people who are unfamiliar with the US city system, a state contains counties and counties contains one or more cities.

### Data
